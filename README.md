# youtube-video-qa
We build a YouTube Video Q&amp;A system where users enter a video URL and ask questions about its content. The system extracts transcripts, processes them, and answers queries using both a keyword baseline and an improved LLM-based retrieval model, with full evaluation and error analysis.
